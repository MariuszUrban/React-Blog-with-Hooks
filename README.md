# REACT BLOG APP

Simple React app build exclusively on variety of hooks as a practice. 

In app I used basic React Hooks API to get familiar with general concepts of hooks, 
checked few of community hooks, 
created and tested custom hooks, 
and simulated simple backend. 

## Tests

```sh
npm install
npm test
```
